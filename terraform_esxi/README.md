# Terraform ESXi

Originally there was a free tool to allow API access to the ESXi server without the need of vSphere/vCenter.

This tool was free, but at the same time was propriatary. Due to legal reasons access may or may not be possible.

Open-source versions of this tool are available, and I'll add them as found.

# Pre-reqs

In order to use this tool you need to enable SSH on the ESXi server (this isn't needed for vCenter, as it has a proper API service)
